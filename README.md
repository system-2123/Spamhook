To make this work, make a folder add a txt file into it and add the exe in it aswell. Its very simple! Then open the exe it should work. A error message will pop up if it does not.
(I am NOT Responsible for whatever you do with this script.) After that, add your Discord Webhook in and then it will ask you how much messages you want to send. If it is capped i will try and fix it.
I will leave the source code only.
TXT NEEDS TO BE NAME messages.txt MAKING THIS FILE A EXE COULD MAYBE RUIN THE SCRIPT.
